# Mass Changing UUID Tool

## Notes

- You can remove the `empty.txt` file in the `files` folder. It was just there to get github to create the folder.

## Changing Background Goal UUIDS

- Open folder in VSCode
- Run `npm install" in the folder
- Drop files in "files" folder
- Run `npm start`

## Changing Handles

- Open folder in VSCode
- Run `npm install" in the folder
- Drop files in "files" folder
- Run `npm run cleantext`

Both functions require `BackgroundGoals.tbl` so make sure that it is included in the `files` directory.
